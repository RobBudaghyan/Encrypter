## Working Principle

Orion uses RSA public and private keys to exchange messages through its servers. It uses 2048 bit keys, which guarantees the safety of the user's message. For instance, in order for a computer to crack the cipher stored in Orion's servers 300 trillion years are needed :) Here's a simple visual representation of the working principle of messaging.
